        <p>A little something different from traditional mashed potatoes, 
            for the Instant Pot. The leeks add a very mild onion flavor. Enjoy!</p>

                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">½ teaspoon coarse salt</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">water to cover</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">⅓ cup milk, warmed</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">2 tablespoons butter</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">salt to taste</a></li>
              </ul>
            
              <ol>Directions
            
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">Step 1: Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Add water to cover, about 2 cups. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">Step 2: Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain potatoes well and return them to the pot.

</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267894/instant-pot-leek-mashed-potatoes/">Step 3: Select Saute function. Toss potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash, or run them through a ricer for a smoother mash. Taste and adjust the salt.</a></li>
